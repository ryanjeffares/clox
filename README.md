# clox

This is my C implementation of Lox, from [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com) by Robert Nystrom.

When I have finished the book I will add documentation for the additional features I added, beyond the implementation from the book.

To build, simply:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
